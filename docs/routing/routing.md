# Routing

In `WebWombat` you can create routes to serve requests, by assign routes to controllers.

## Defining routes

You can define routes with the following classes:
 - [Route](route.md)
 - [RouteGroup](routeGroup.md)

## Getting routes
You can get previously defined routes with the [`RouteService`](./routeService.md).
